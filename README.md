## Why do I do this to myself?
This project is basically me trying to piece together the design of modern microprocessors. I have no formal education in chip design, only very helpful friends that do chip design for a living giving me pointers. I find it really helpful to mess around and find out while learning so I decided to run before I could walk and the design probably reflects that quite a lot :)

## Very cool people who helped me
Would like to thank the following people for either helping me directly or giving me some great advice when it comes to chip design and the processes around it:
